The Moonbeam XCM SDK enables developers to easily deposit and withdraw assets to Moonbeam/Moonriver from the relay chain and other parachains in the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem. With the SDK, you don't need to worry about determining the multilocation of the origin or destination assets or which extrinsics are used on which networks to send XCM transfers. To deposit or withdraw assets, you simply define the asset and origin chain you want to deposit from or withdraw back to, along with the sending account's signer, and the amount to send.
